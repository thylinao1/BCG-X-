## 🚀 Phase 1: Financial Trend Analysis (2022–2024)

### Objective
Extract, analyze, and synthesize financial performance data for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple to establish the knowledge base for AI-driven decision support.

### Technical Execution

#### Data Extraction
- **Source:** SEC EDGAR database (audited 10-K filings)
- **Companies:** Microsoft, Tesla, Apple
- **Time Span:** Fiscal Years 2022–2024
- **Metrics:** Total Revenue, Net Income, Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Operating Cash Flow

#### Advanced Analytics
```python
# Feature engineering for financial insights
df['Revenue Growth (%)'] = df.groupby('Company')['Total Revenue'].pct_change() * 100
df['Net Margin (%)'] = (df['Net Income'] / df['Total Revenue']) * 100
df['OpCF/Revenue (%)'] = (df['Cash Flow from Operating Activities'] / df['Total Revenue']) * 100

# 2-year CAGR calculation
def cagr(start, end, n):
    return (end/start)**(1/n) - 1
```

#### Methodology
1. **Manual Data Extraction** from SEC 10-K filings (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** for AI model compatibility
3. **Feature Engineering** – YoY growth rates, profitability margins, leverage ratios, cash conversion metrics
4. **Comparative Analysis** – Cross-company benchmarking and trend identification
5. **Visualization** – Multi-year performance charts for key financial indicators

### Key Findings

| Company | Revenue CAGR | Net Income CAGR | Cash Efficiency | Net Margin | Strategic Position |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Microsoft** | +11.2% | +10.1% | 45% OpCF/Revenue | 35% | Cloud & AI expansion driving consistent growth |
| **Apple** | -0.4% | -3.1% | 30% OpCF/Revenue | 25% | Mature market, excellent cash generation |
| **Tesla** | +9.5% | -24.6% | 16% OpCF/Revenue | 13% | Growth normalizing, profitability challenges |

### Strategic Insights
- **Microsoft:** Best-in-class growth and profitability, low leverage (~48%)
- **Apple:** Stable cash engine with high leverage (~84%) tied to shareholder returns
- **Tesla:** High-variance growth story with margin compression concerns

### Business Impact
- Identified **Microsoft as the sustainable growth leader** with superior cash generation
- Highlighted **Apple's resilience** despite flat revenue growth
- Flagged **Tesla's efficiency challenges** requiring operational focus

## 🤖 Phase 2: AI-Powered Financial Chatbot

### Objective
Build an interactive chatbot that transforms static financial data into conversational, accessible insights for stakeholders without technical expertise.

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Components
- **Rule-Based Logic Engine** – If-else decision trees for deterministic query matching
- **Data Retrieval Layer** – Pandas-based filtering and aggregation
- **Conversational Interface** – Interactive command-line with natural language processing foundation
- **Error Handling System** – Graceful escalation for unrecognized queries

#### Implementation Highlights
```python
# Intelligent query processing with state management
while True:
    user_query = input("> ").strip().lower()
    
    if user_query == "show latest for microsoft":
        sub = df[df["Company"] == "Microsoft"]
        latest = sub[sub["Fiscal Year"] == sub["Fiscal Year"].max()]
        return latest[["Company", "Fiscal Year", "Total Revenue", "Net Income"]]
    
    elif user_query not in predefined_queries:
        return "I'll connect you to an agent for assistance."
```

### Chatbot Capabilities

**10 Predefined Financial Queries:**
1. Revenue analysis across all companies
2. Net income performance metrics
3. Operating cash flow comparisons
4. Total assets overview
5. Liability structure analysis
6. Multi-metric consolidated view
7. Company list exploration
8. Fiscal year data availability
9. Latest Microsoft financials
10. Latest Tesla financials

### User Experience Flow
