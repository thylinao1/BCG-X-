## ü§ñ Project Overview

An **interactive rule-based financial chatbot** that transforms complex 10-K financial data into accessible, conversational insights. This project demonstrates practical AI application in finance by building a query-response system that retrieves and presents financial metrics for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple (FY 2022‚Äì2024).

**Context:** Developed as part of BCG X GenAI Consulting virtual experience program, simulating real-world AI chatbot development for Global Finance Corp.'s digital transformation initiative.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.10+** ‚Äì Core programming language
- **Pandas** ‚Äì Financial data manipulation and retrieval
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Interactive development environment
- **IPython** ‚Äì Enhanced interactive computing

### Design Pattern: Rule-Based Logic
```python
# Core chatbot architecture
if user_query == "what is the revenue for the companies":
    return df[["Company", "Fiscal Year", "Total Revenue (USDm)"]]
elif user_query == "show latest for microsoft":
    sub = df[df["Company"] == "Microsoft"]
    latest = sub[sub["Fiscal Year"] == sub["Fiscal Year"].max()]
    return latest[["Company", "Fiscal Year", "Total Revenue (USDm)", "Net Income (USDm)"]]
else:
    return "This question isn't in the 10 predefined ones. I'll connect you to an agent."
```

### State Management
- **Session Persistence:** Single conversation loop with continuous query processing
- **Data Caching:** Financial dataset loaded once at initialization
- **Query Normalization:** Input standardization via `.strip().lower()`

---

## üìä Data Integration

### Source Data
- **Dataset:** `10-K_Financials__USD_millions_.csv`
- **Companies:** Apple, Microsoft, Tesla
- **Time Period:** Fiscal Years 2022‚Äì2024
- **Metrics:** 
  - Total Revenue
  - Net Income
  - Total Assets
  - Total Liabilities
  - Operating Cash Flow

### Data Structure
```python
# Sample data schema
Company | Fiscal Year | Total Revenue (USDm) | Net Income (USDm) | Total Assets (USDm) | ...
--------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----
Apple   | 2024        | 391,035             | 93,736            | 364,980             | ...
```

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### User Interaction Flow
```
1. Chatbot displays 10 available queries
2. User enters query (case-insensitive)
3. System matches query to predefined response logic
4. Chatbot retrieves relevant data from DataFrame
5. Results displayed in formatted table
6. Loop continues until user types "exit" or "quit"
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Unrecognized Queries:** Polite escalation message directing to human support
- **Input Exceptions:** Graceful handling of EOF and keyboard interrupts
- **Data Validation:** Pre-loaded dataset ensures query responses always available

## üíª Running the Chatbot

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas jupyter ipython
```

### Execution Steps
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd financial-chatbot

# Ensure data file is in same directory
# File: 10-K_Financials__USD_millions_.csv

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook ChatBot.ipynb

# Run all cells to start chatbot
```

### Sample Interaction
```
Chatbot. Type one of the 10 questions below, or 'exit'.

1) what is the revenue for the companies
2) what is the net income for the companies
[...additional queries...]

> show latest for microsoft
     Company  Fiscal Year  Total Revenue (USDm)  Net Income (USDm)
3  Microsoft         2024                245122              88136

> quit
Bye!
```
